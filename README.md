# Last-mile-drone-delivery-problem

## Overview

This project implements and compares two advanced approaches for solving the multi-depot drone routing problem inspired by Zipline's drone delivery system. The system maximizes order completion scores while considering order priorities, battery constraints, and cross-depot optimization for efficient fleet management.

- **Order priorities** (Low, Medium, High, Emergency) with associated scores
- **Cross-depot operations** for optimal resource utilization
- **Real-time assignment decisions** under strict time constraints
- **Battery management** and charging optimization

### 2. Advanced GNN Approach (Machine Learning Enhanced)

**Complete workflow:**

**Step 1: Train the GNN model**
```bash
python gnn.py train
```
- Loads training data from 12 selected instances (first of each region-size combination)
- Trains advanced cross-depot aware GNN with attention mechanisms
- Saves trained model as `gnn_model.pth`

**Step 2: Test on sample instance**
```bash
python gnn.py sample
```
- Runs single instance with visualization
- Demonstrates GNN-based assignment decisions
- Shows cross-depot operations and future planning

**Step 3: Evaluate on all instances**
```bash
python gnn.py batch
```
- Processes all instances without visualization
- Generates comprehensive comparison results
- Saves results to `GNN_results/gnn_approach.csv`
